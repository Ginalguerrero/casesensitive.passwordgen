#Secured password generator for sensitive data

##As an employee with sensitive data the lists of certain criteria must be met in order to generate a password

##The criteria :
-The length of the characters must be 8-128 total 
-Must include Uppercase
-Must include lowercase
-Must have atleast a special character

##As a developer
I made variables for each criteria needed 
Each variable contains an array of lists of all the possible characters, numbers,and alphabets
I then included a prompt for each criteria 
followed by an if/else conditional statement
Once the input is validated 
the output should generate a random password based on criteria
